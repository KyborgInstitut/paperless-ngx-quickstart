### Personal Philosophy

> *"Be more yourself, take responsibility for your life or others will decide over you. Found a family, love your wife and children, support your family first. If you can do more, then serve particular others. Build something that matters to you and supports the evolution of your children and your environment - that develops a better society as a whole. Impress others by showing results and progress, but don't shout it out until a step is done."*

### Background

Born in 1987, Tobias holds a Master of Arts in Social Science, with research focused on the individual development of human beings in relation to society. His academic work critiqued mainstream sociology's approach to altruism, arguing that:

- True altruism can only emerge from individual freedom and authentic self-expression
- Suppressing individual development to fit collective expectations actually harms both the individual and society
- Collectivist approaches, despite their intentions, often suppress genuine altruistic behavior
- Respecting individual expression - even when it challenges norms - creates space for authentic goodness

This philosophy directly influences his approach to technology: creating tools that empower individuals rather than forcing them into expensive, complex systems designed for corporations.

### Why This Project?

This management tool was born from practical necessity:

- **Personal need**: Managing documentation for multiple entities (the institute, a GmbH, family obligations) under Germany's strict bureaucratic requirements
- **GoBD compliance**: Protecting small businesses from legal pressure without expensive proprietary solutions
- **Time freedom**: Automating paperwork so people can focus on meaningful work
- **Frustration with the industry**: Too many overpriced "solutions" from developers who take money without delivering real value

As Tobias puts it: *"Getting the paperwork done quickly protects us from the state, so we can return to our actual work."*

### On AI and the Future

Tobias sees AI as a powerful equalizer:

> *"AI has very big potential to free people as a whole. Especially as tutors, AIs are already a big possibility to get quicker and deeper into new topics than any expensive course can offer. It can initiate a rush of new creativity and break through the stuck thinking of people who try to hold new ideas down."*

This project demonstrates that vision: a comprehensive management tool created in hours rather than months, freely shared to help others.

## Kyborg Institut & Research

### History

The **Kyborg Institut** was originally founded by **Detlef Harald Alke** as *"Kyborg Institut & Verlag"* (Institute & Publishing).

The name "Kyborg" stands for **K**undalini **Y**oga **B**ased **Org**anisation - reflecting its foundation in consciousness development and spiritual practice.

Detlef's life work included:
- **Energytraining**: A versatile training system based on Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan
- **Horus Energy Pyramid**: Developed in 1990, a double-pyramid design for energy work
- **Pyramid Line**: A 300-meter installation in southern France (near Toulouse), ranging from 18cm to 9-meter pyramids
- **Seminar Center**: Located in Flörsheim-Dalsheim, Germany, featuring the large 9-meter Horus Energy Pyramid

### The Transition

In December 2022, Tobias took over the institute due to his father's health. The name evolved to **"Kyborg Institut & Research"** - reflecting a new emphasis on practical research and development while honoring the original mission.

Detlef is still alive, and father and son speak daily. The institute's evolution represents continuity and growth: the spiritual foundation remains, now complemented by practical tools that free people's time and resources.

### Current Mission

The Kyborg Institut aims to be:

> *"A place where creative and innovative people find an inspiring and grounding space that connects to our inner soul. Tools that free time and resources help us keep going forward faster."*

**Core values:**
- Individual freedom and authentic self-expression
- Practical tools that serve people (not systems that enslave them)
- Consciousness development and spiritual growth
- Supporting families, entrepreneurs, and seekers
- Open sharing in the spirit of true altruism

### Future Vision

- More practical tools for small businesses and individuals
- 3D printing and Arduino projects to help disabled people regain freedom
- AI-assisted development to break through traditional barriers
- Building a community of constructive, positive thinkers
- Spreading responsibility, trust, and self-love

## A Note on True Altruism

This project is released freely, not because we expect nothing in return, but because we believe that genuine giving - without coercion or obligation - creates real value in the world.

As Tobias's research concluded: altruism cannot be forced. It emerges naturally when individuals are free to develop authentically and choose to give from abundance rather than compulsion.

Use this tool freely. If it helps you, perhaps one day you'll create something that helps someone else.

*Freely given, freely received.*
